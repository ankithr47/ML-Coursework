The ThingsEEG-Text dataset is a comprehensive resource designed for studying the relationship between brain activity and natural language processing. It includes EEG data recorded from participants viewing object images (from the Things dataset), along with corresponding textual descriptions. The dataset aims to explore the connection between visual perception and language processing, specifically focusing on how semantic representations of objects can be decoded from brain activity. With EEG recordings from multiple participants and a diverse range of images paired with text descriptions, ThingsEEG-Text serves as a valuable resource for research in multimodal cognitive neuroscience, helping to understand neural and semantic processes during object perception.\n"

        "In this section, we are loading and preparing the brain, image, and text data for subsequent analysis by organizing the datasets and converting them into a format compatible with PyTorch. Here's a step-by-step description of the key operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Loading**:\n",
        "\n",
        "The code first sets up the data directories by constructing paths for different datasets, including brain, image, and text features. It organizes these paths based on the subject identifier, data type (training or testing), and the model used (e.g., image and text models).\n",
        "The datasets are loaded from .mat files using the scipy.io.loadmat() function. This function reads the data into numpy arrays, facilitating data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Preprocessing**:\n",
        "\n",
        "For the brain data, specific time intervals are extracted (70ms-400ms), and the data is reshaped to a two-dimensional format to simplify analysis.\n",
        "Image and text data are scaled to enhance numerical stability during model training.\n",
        "Dimensionality reduction is applied to the image data to limit the number of features, making the dataset more manageable and reducing computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conversion to PyTorch Tensors**:\n",
        "\n",
        "The numpy arrays for each dataset (brain, image, text, and labels) are converted into PyTorch tensors. This conversion is crucial for efficient data handling in neural network training, as tensors are optimized for operations on GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Summary**:\n",
        "\n",
        "The code prints the shape of each dataset, providing an overview of the number of samples and features for both training and testing sets. This summary helps confirm that the data is correctly formatted and that the expected number of features is present.\n",

        "   - The model consists of four fully connected layers:\n",
        "     - **Input layer**: Takes in the number of features from the brain data.\n",
        "     - **Three hidden layers**: Each layer applies a linear transformation followed by the ReLU activation function, with 256, 128, and 64 neurons respectively.\n",
        "     - **Output layer**: Maps the hidden layer output to the number of classes (50 in this case) without any activation function, as `CrossEntropyLoss` handles the logits.\n",
        "   - **Activation function**: ReLU is applied to the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### • **Training the Model**:\n",
        "   - **`train_model()` function**:\n",
        "     - The model is trained for a specified number of epochs (1000 in this case).\n",
        "     - The training process involves forward propagation, loss computation using `CrossEntropyLoss`, and backpropagation to update the model parameters with the Adam optimizer.\n",
        "     - After each epoch, the loss is printed, allowing tracking of the model's progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "### • **Testing the Model**:\n",
        "   - **`test_model()` function**:\n",
        "     - During evaluation, the model is set to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`), and no gradients are computed.\n",
        "     - The model predicts the top 5 class labels for each test sample using `torch.topk()`.\n",
        "     - The **Top-1 Accuracy** (whether the top predicted label matches the true label) and **Top-5 Accuracy** (whether the true label is among the top 5 predictions) are calculated and printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### • **Data Preparation**:\n",
        "   - The training and testing data are converted to `float` type, while labels are converted to `long` integers, which is required by PyTorch.\n",
        "   - The labels are also adjusted by subtracting 1 to ensure they range from 0 to 49, as PyTorch expects zero-based indexing for class labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### • **Model Initialization**:\n",
        "   - A `BrainModel` is initialized with 50 output classes (for classification) and the number of features from the brain data.\n",
        "   - The Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of `0.001`, and `CrossEntropyLoss` is used as the loss function for this multi-class classification task.\n",
